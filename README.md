My first readme

Despite the fact that I've been pushing my projects to github before I even started studying with ALX, I've learn new git commands that are powerful

I learnt git checkout command and more

Thanks to ALX. Now pushing my projects to github would be a lot of ease

Thanks to ALX once more!
